## Architecture overview

Recommended configuration is two Azure AD proxy servers for dual redundancy and loading the DC agent on all domain controllers.

Software Pre-Requisites:

- All machines where the Azure AD Password Protection proxy service will be installed must have .NET 4.7.2 installed
- All machines that host the Azure AD Password Protection proxy service must be configured to grant domain controllers the ability to log on to the proxy service. This ability is controlled via the "Access this computer from the network" privilege assignment.
- All machines that host the Azure AD Password Protection proxy service must be configured to allow outbound TLS 1.2 HTTP traffic.
- A Global Administrator or Security Administrator account to register the Azure AD Password Protection proxy service and forest with Azure AD.
- Network access must be enabled for the set of ports and URLs specified in the [Application Proxy environment setup procedures.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application#prepare-your-on-premises-environment)

On Proxy Server:

Import Azure AD Password Protection Modules

```
Import-Module AzureADPasswordProtection
```

Check and make sure Azure AD Password Protection proxy service is running on your servers

```
Get-Service AzureADPasswordProtectionProxy | fl
```

Register your Azure AD proxies using interactive mode. This worked best for me and since my GA account has MFA turned on. 

```
Register-AzureADPasswordProtectionProxy -AccountUpn 'yourglobaladmin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com'
```

Register your Azure AD forest. 

```
Register-AzureADPasswordProtectionForest -AccountUpn 'yourglobaladmin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com'
```

Here is how to add proxy auth if your Password protection proxy servers are sitting behind a corporate proxy. 

Create a AzureADPasswordProtectionProxy.exe.config file in the %ProgramFiles%\Azure AD Password Protection Proxy\Service folder.

```
<configuration>
   <system.net>
      <defaultProxy enabled="true">
      <proxy bypassonlocal="true"
         proxyaddress="http://yourhttpproxy.com:8080" />
      </defaultProxy>
   </system.net>
</configuration>
```

If your proxy listens to something other than port 8080 then you will need to do this:

```
Set-AzureADPasswordProtectionProxyConfiguration â€“StaticPort <portnumber>
```
