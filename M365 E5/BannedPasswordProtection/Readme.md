## Architecture overview

Recommended configuration is two Azure AD proxy servers for dual redundancy and loading the DC agent on all domain controllers.

Software Pre-Requisites:

- All machines where the Azure AD Password Protection proxy service will be installed must have .NET 4.7.2 installed
- All machines that host the Azure AD Password Protection proxy service must be configured to grant domain controllers the ability to log on to the proxy service. This ability is controlled via the "Access this computer from the network" privilege assignment.
- All machines that host the Azure AD Password Protection proxy service must be configured to allow outbound TLS 1.2 HTTP traffic.
- A Global Administrator or Security Administrator account to register the Azure AD Password Protection proxy service and forest with Azure AD.
- Network access must be enabled for the set of ports and URLs specified in the [Application Proxy environment setup procedures.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application#prepare-your-on-premises-environment)

On Proxy Server:

Import Azure AD Password Protection Modules

```
Import-Module AzureADPasswordProtection
```

Check and make sure Azure AD Password Protection proxy service is running on your servers

```
Get-Service AzureADPasswordProtectionProxy | fl
```

Register your Azure AD proxies using interactive mode. This worked best for me and since my GA account has MFA turned on. 

```
Register-AzureADPasswordProtectionProxy -AccountUpn 'yourglobaladmin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com'
```

Register your Azure AD forest. 

```
Register-AzureADPasswordProtectionForest -AccountUpn 'yourglobaladmin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com'
```

Here is how to add proxy auth if your Password protection proxy servers are sitting behind a corporate proxy. 

Create a AzureADPasswordProtectionProxy.exe.config file in the %ProgramFiles%\Azure AD Password Protection Proxy\Service folder.

```
<configuration>
   <system.net>
      <defaultProxy enabled="true">
      <proxy bypassonlocal="true"
         proxyaddress="http://yourhttpproxy.com:8080" />
      </defaultProxy>
   </system.net>
</configuration>
```

If your proxy listens to something other than port 8080 then you will need to do this:

```
Set-AzureADPasswordProtectionProxyConfiguration â€“StaticPort <portnumber>
```

## Audit mode vs. Enforcement mode

Its highly recommended to do audit mode first so you can gauge your overall password change health your end users are making. There is a strong tendency to just turn it on. This will drive up confusion and help desk calls because some end users will legitmately not know what they are doing wrong when they are choosing a password that is bad. Below is an example of turning on banned password protection in audit mode once you have your DC agents and proxy servers running.

## Monitoring and Reporting Azure AD Banned Password Protection

URL Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-password-ban-bad-on-premises-monitor

Monitoring specific event ID's 

The chart below is handy for specific monitoring. A few FAQ's.

- Why two event ID's? This is due to Microsoft Banned password policies and organization custom list banned password policies. 
- What is the difference between password change and password set? Think of it this way. An end user will do a password change to their account. The help desk will do a password set to an account. It's important to monitor both because help desk staff can make bad password decisions even if temporary.

Before you get custom password lists or enforcement modes you can query event ID 30010 this should detect audit failures of password changes that are either present in Microsoft's banned password policy or your own. 

Get a Grid view of failures on multiple domain controllers:

```
$S = 'DC1' , 'DC2'
ForEach ($Server in $S) {
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{logName='Microsoft-AzureADPasswordProtection-DCAgent/Admin'; id=30010} -ComputerName $Server | Out-GridView }
```
